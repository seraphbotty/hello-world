# We should take each number an check if the number is even or odd
# The operator to evaluate even or odd of a number is % operator
# if number % == 0: number is even
# else: number is odd.
# Instead of repeating the above codes for each number, we can use the loop
# to step through the list
# We have while loop and for-loop, two loop structures
# Since it is a list, we should use for-loop: loop through a sequence

# We need to count numbers, so we need counters.

# which means for loop stepped through the entire list
