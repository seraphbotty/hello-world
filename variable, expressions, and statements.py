#for defining a variable you would let python do it with the function
#print(type(your variable to test))
#
#print(type(1))
#which would come back as a int, because it is a number
#print(type("where are you"))
#which comes back as a string because of the "" around the words
#print(type("1,2,3,4"))
#also is considered a string because of the "" around the numbers
#strings can also be inclosed in either double quotes or single quotes or triple quotes
#print(type("""what are you doing here blah"""))
#we can also convert variables from one type to another useing python
#print(3.14, int(3.14))
#print(3.999, int(3.999))
#print("1234", int("1234"))
#print(17, int(17))
#print(int("2bottles"))# can't be converted to an integer because it contains no numbers
#print(float("123.45"))
#print(type(float("123.45")))
#print(str(17))
#print(str(123.45))
#print(type(str(123.45)))
#assignment statements
# the = is the assaignment statement
#the == means the 2 variables are equal or the same.
#name = "What's up doc?"
#n = 17
#pi = 3.14
#print(message)
#print(n)
#print(pi)
#len("luther")
#double // indicates intiger division
#print(15//3)
# using the % is the modulus function and it will output the remainder of any division
#print(15%3)
